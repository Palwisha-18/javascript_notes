<h3>JavaScript Error Handling</h3>

- `try...catch` statement:
    * used to handle exceptions in JavaScript.
    * place only the code that may cause an exception in the `try` block.
    * implement the logic to handle the error in the `catch` block.
    * the error object has at least two properties:
        - `name` - specifies the error name.
        - `message` explains the error in detail.

- `try...catch...finally` statement:
    * `finally` clause in the `try...catch...finally` statement is used to execute a block whether exceptions occur or not.
    * ignores the return statement in the try and catch blocks because the finally block always executes.

- `throw` statement:
    * used to throw an exception.
