<h3>JavaScript Functions:</h3>

- use the `function` *keyword* to declare a function.
- use the `functionName()` to call a function.
- when declaring a function, we specify the `parameters`. However, when calling a function, we pass the `arguments` that are corresponding to the parameters.
- all functions implicitly return undefined if they donâ€™t explicitly return a value.
- use the `return` statement to return a value from a function explicitly.
- the `arguments` variable is an array-like object inside a function, representing function arguments.
- the function hoisting allows you to call a function before declaring it.
- functions are first-class citizens:
    * this means that we can store functions in variables, pass them to other functions as arguments, and return them from other functions as values.
- anonymous function:
    * function with name.
- arrow function:
    * provides a shorthand for declaring anonymous functions
- JavaScript passes all arguments to a function by values
- function arguments are local variables
- recursive function:
    * a function that calls itself.
    * always has a condition that stops the function from calling itself.
- default function parameters:
    * allow us to initialize named parameters with default values if no values or `undefined` are passed into the function.
