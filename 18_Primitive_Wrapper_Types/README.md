<h3>JavaScript Primitive Wrapper Types:</h3>

- Primitive Wrapper Types:
    * make it easier to use primitive values including booleans, numbers, and strings. `typeof` return `object` for these tyoes.
    * when an object of a reference type is created using the `new` operator, the object will stay in the memory until it goes out of scope. However, an automatically created primitive wrapper object exists for one line of code only.
    * `Boolean` is a wrapper object of the `boolean` primitive type.
    * `Bigint` is a wrapper object of the `bigint` primitive type.
    * `Number` is a wrapper object of the `number` primitive type.
    * `String` is a wrapper object of the `string` primitive type.
