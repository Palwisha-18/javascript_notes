<h3>JavaScript Logical Assignment Operators:</h3>

- logical OR assignment (`||=`):
    * assigns the right operand to the left operand if the left operand is falsy.
- logical AND assignment (`&&=`)
    * assigns the right operand to the left operand if the left operand is truthy.
- Nullish coalescing assignment (`??=`)
    * assigns the right operand to the left operand if the left operand is `null` or `undefined`.
