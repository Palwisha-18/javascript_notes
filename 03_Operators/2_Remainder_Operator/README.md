<h3>JavaScript Remainder Operator:</h3>

- Remainder Operator (`%`)
    * gives remainder of a number divided by another number.
    * the sign of the remainder is the same as the sign of the dividend.
    * if a value is not a number, the JavaScript engine will:
        1. convert the value to a number using the Number() function.
        2. apply the remainder function.

- Modulo
    * in JavaScript can be calculated using this expression: `((dividend % divisor) + divisor) % divisor`
    * if the division and divisor have the same sign, the remainder and modulo operators return the same result. Otherwise, they return different results.
