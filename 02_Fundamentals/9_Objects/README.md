<h3>JavaScript Objects:</h3>

- are an *unordered* collections of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is called a `property`.
- key of a property can be a string and the value of a property can be any value e.g., a string, a number, an array, and even a function.
- to access a objectâ€™s property, we can use the dot notation (`.`) or the array-like notation (`[]`).
- `delete` operator removes a property from an object.
- `in` operator can check if a property exists in an object.
