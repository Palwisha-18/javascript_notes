<h3>JavaScript Variables:</h3>

- variables are used to store values and are case-sensitive. Rules of identifiers apply to variables.
- `var` keyword is used to declare/initalize the variable.
- starting ES6, `let` keyword can also be used to declare/initialize the variable.
- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. Therefore, we don't need to specify variable's type.
- convention for variables is camelcase like `message` and `myCounter`.
- an undefined variable is a variable that has been declared but has not been initialized with a value.
- an undeclared variable is a variable that has not been declared
- `const` keyword is used to intialize constant variables whose values don't change. It defines a readonly reference to a value.
