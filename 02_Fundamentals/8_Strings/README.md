<h3>JavaScript Strings:</h3>

- are primitive values and immutable.
- are delimited by single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or backticks (`) (introuced in ES6).
- has `length` property  which returns the length of the string.
- values can be converted to strings using following methods:
    * `String(n);`
    * `" + n`
    * `n.toString()`
- comparison operators `>, >=, <, <=, ==`  can be used to compare strings.
- special characters can be escaped using the `\` character:
    * Windows line break: `'\r\n'`
    * Unix line break: `'\n'`
    * Tab: `'\t'`
    * Backslash `'\'`
