<h3>JavaScript Arrays:</h3>

- an array is an ordered list of values. Each value is called an element specified by an index.
- an array can hold values of mixed types.
- the size of an array is dynamic and auto-growing.
- two ways create arrays:
    * use `Array()` constructor
    * use array literal notation: `[element1, element2, element3, ...]`
- `arrayName[index]` notation can be used to access array elements.
- `arrayName.length` can be used to get number of elements in the array.
- `push()` method can be used to add an element to the end of array.
- `unshift()` method can be used to add an element to the start of array.
- `pop()` method can be used to remove an element from the end of the array.
- `shift()` method can be used to remove an element from the start of array.
- `indexOf()` method can be used to find the index of an element.
- `Array.isArray()` method can be used to check if a value is an array.
