<h3>Javascript Control Flow Statements:</h3>

- `if` statement:
    * executes a code block if a condition is `true`.
- `if ... else` statement:
    * if a condition is `true`, executes the code block that follows `if` branch. Otherwise, executes `else` branch.
- `if ... else ... if` statement:
    * checks multiple conditions and execute the corresponding block if a condition is `true`.
- `?:` ternary operator:
    * alternative for `if ... else` statement to make code more concise and easy to read.
- `switch ... case` statement:
    * the `switch` statement evaluates an `expression`, compares its result with `case` values, and executes the statement associated with the matching `case` value.
    * uses the strict comparison (`===`) to compare the expression with the case values.
- `while` statement:
    * executes a block as long as a condition is `true`.
- `do ... while` statement:
    * executes a block until a condition evaluates to `false`.
    * executes the statement at least once before evaluating the expression.
- `for` statement:
    * used to create a loop that execute a block based using various options.
- `break` statement:
    * used to terminate a loop prematurely.
    * when used in a nested loop, the break statement terminates the enclosing loop. To terminate the nested loop, you use a `label` statement.
- `continue` statement:
    * used to skip the current iteration of a loop.
- `comma` seperator:
    * takes two expressions and evaluates them from left to right, and returns the value of the right expression.
